**Planning Assessment Summary:**
Your proposed development has been analyzed against local and national planning policies. The AI assessment indicates a **87% likelihood of approval** with the following key considerations:

**Policy Compliance Analysis:**
‚úÖ **Compliant Areas:**
- Proposed scale and massing align with local character (Policy DM1)
- Adequate parking provision meets current standards
- No significant heritage constraints identified
- Environmental impact within acceptable parameters

‚ö†Ô∏è  **Areas Requiring Attention:**
- Rear garden depth marginally below preferred standard (8.5m vs 9m recommended)
- Consider biodiversity enhancement measures for higher policy alignment
- Drainage assessment may be required depending on site characteristics

**AI Recommendations:**
1. **Design Optimization:** Slight reduction in rear projection (0.5m) would ensure full policy compliance
2. **Enhancement Opportunities:** Adding green roof or wall features would strengthen environmental credentials
3. **Pre-submission Actions:** Consider ecology survey if mature trees present
4. **Risk Mitigation:** Early engagement with highways team recommended for access arrangements

**Predicted Processing Timeline:**
- Pre-application: 2-3 weeks
- Full application: 6-8 weeks (standard householder process)
- Committee referral: Unlikely (delegated decision predicted)

**Success Probability Analysis:**
- Approval likelihood: 87%
- Conditions likely: 3-4 standard conditions
- Neighbor objection risk: Low (15% based on similar cases)
- Appeal risk if refused: Very low

**Next Steps:**
1. Consider implementing AI recommendations above
2. Submit pre-application for formal officer guidance
3. Prepare application with supporting documents as outlined
4. Monitor for any policy updates during preparation period""",
