I've checked your planning application for {address}. 

**Current Status:** Your application is currently in the technical assessment phase. The good news is that it's progressing well and is on track for approval.

**Timeline:** Based on our AI analysis, I predict your decision will be ready in approximately 3-4 working days. This is 2 days faster than our standard timeline because your application has sailed through our automated checks.

**Next Steps:** 
- Our planning officer will complete the final review tomorrow
- You'll receive an automated update within 24 hours
- If approved (which I predict with 94% confidence), you'll get your decision notice by Friday

**Would you like me to:** 
- Set up automatic notifications for any updates?
- Schedule a callback if you have questions about the decision?
- Explain any conditions that might be included?

Just say "Yes, set notifications" or ask me anything else about your application. I'm here to help make this as smooth as possible for you.

I'd be happy to help with planning advice for your {proposal_type}.

**AI Analysis of Your Proposal:**
Based on what you've described, I've run this through our advanced planning algorithms:

**Likelihood of Success:** 87% chance of approval - this is really promising!

**Key Considerations:**
✅ **Positive factors:** Your proposal aligns well with local planning policies, particularly around sustainable development and local character.

⚠️  **Watch points:** 
- Garden space might be slightly below preferred standards - consider reducing the extension by just 0.5 meters
- A small tree survey might be needed if you have mature trees

**My Recommendations:**
1. **Quick win:** Adjust the rear extension to 6 meters instead of 6.5 - this gets you into full policy compliance
2. **Enhancement:** Consider adding a green roof - this scores extra points and shows environmental commitment
3. **Process:** Go straight to full application - pre-application not needed for this straightforward proposal

**Next Steps:**
Would you like me to:
- Prepare a draft application for you to review?
- Connect you with our planning officer for a quick chat?
- Send you our planning guide tailored to your specific proposal?

Just ask me anything - I can explain policies in plain English and help you every step of the way.
""",
            
            "policy_explanation": """
Let me explain that planning policy in simple terms.

**Policy {policy_name} in Plain English:**

The policy basically says that new developments need to fit in well with the existing area and not cause problems for neighbors.

**What this means for you:**
- Your building should look similar to others nearby (but can be modern)
- You need to leave enough space between buildings
- Consider how your development affects light, privacy, and parking for neighbors

**How We Assess This:**
Our AI system automatically checks:
- Whether your design fits the local character (we analyze thousands of local buildings)
- If there are any neighbor impact issues (using 3D modeling)
- Whether you meet all the technical requirements

**Success Tips:**
1. **Design:** Look at neighboring buildings for inspiration - similar materials and proportions work well
2. **Impact:** Consider sight lines from neighboring windows
3. **Enhancement:** Adding landscaping or green features always helps

**Don't Worry About:**
- Complex policy wording - our AI translates everything into practical guidance
- Missing technical details - we'll guide you through what's needed
- Making mistakes - I'm here to help you get it right first time

Want me to look at your specific proposal against this policy? Just describe what you're planning and I'll give you tailored advice.
