# üéØ **COUNCIL PROSPECTING STRATEGY**
## *Validate Demand Before Building More*

---

## üîç **MARKET VALIDATION APPROACH**

### **Phase 1: Proof of Concept Demos (This Week)**
**Goal: Validate genuine council interest with current system**

#### **Target Councils (Start Small)**
```bash
Tier 1 Targets (High Pain, Early Adopters):
- Small district councils (5,000-20,000 population)
- Councils with known LLC1/CON29 backlogs  
- Recently criticized for slow search times
- Tech-forward councils (already using cloud systems)

Examples:
- Hart District Council (Hampshire)
- Dacorum Borough Council (Hertfordshire)  
- Runnymede Borough Council (Surrey)
- Bromsgrove District Council (Worcestershire)
- Lichfield District Council (Staffordshire)
```

#### **Demo Script & Materials**
```bash
Demo Agenda (30-45 minutes):
1. Problem Statement (5 mins)
   "LA searches take 20+ days, causing deals to fall through"
   
2. Live System Demo (20 mins)
   - Create new application in real-time
   - Upload LLC1/CON29 documents  
   - Show automated processing and risk assessment
   - Demonstrate SLA tracking and dashboard
   - Show payment processing and communications
   
3. Results Presentation (10 mins)
   - "From 20 days to 2-3 hours processing time"
   - "85%+ automation rate reduces staff workload"  
   - "Real-time status updates improve customer satisfaction"
   - "Integrated payments reduce administration"
   
4. Integration Discussion (10 mins)
   - "We can integrate with your existing systems"
   - "Bulk import your current backlog"
   - "Staff training and transition support"
```

### **Phase 2: Discovery & Requirements (Week 2-3)**
**Goal: Understand specific council needs and pain points**

#### **Key Discovery Questions**
```bash
Volume & Complexity:
- How many LLC1/CON29 requests per month?
- What's your current average processing time?
- What percentage require manual intervention?
- Where are the biggest bottlenecks?

Systems & Integration:
- What back-office system do you use? (Civica/Capita/Northgate/Academy)
- How do applications currently arrive? (Email/portal/post)
- What payment systems do you use?
- Do you have GIS/mapping capabilities?

Staff & Process:
- How many staff work on LA searches?
- What's their skill level with technology?
- What training would they need?
- Who makes procurement decisions?

Pain Points:
- What's your biggest frustration with current process?
- How often do you miss SLA deadlines?  
- What complaints do you get from applicants?
- What would success look like for you?
```

### **Phase 3: Pilot Proposal (Week 4)**
**Goal: Convert interested councils to paid pilots**

#### **Pilot Proposal Template**
```bash
3-Month Paid Pilot Proposal:

Scope:
- Process 100-500 live applications
- Full integration with your existing systems
- Staff training and support

Success Metrics:
- 70%+ reduction in processing time
- 85%+ automation rate
- 95%+ staff satisfaction
- 90%+ applicant satisfaction
- Clear ROI calculation

After Pilot:
- Full system rollout: ¬£2,000-5,000/month

## üìû **OUTREACH STRATEGY**

### **Week 1-2: Initial Contact**
```bash
Channel 1: LinkedIn (Decision Makers)
Target: Head of Planning, IT Director, Chief Executive
Message: "I've built a system that cuts LA search processing from 20 days to 2-3 hours. Would you be interested in a 15-minute demo?"

Channel 2: Direct Email (Department Heads)  
Target: Planning Department Manager, LA Search Team Leader
Subject: "How [Council Name] could process LA searches 10x faster"

Channel 3: Professional Networks
Target: Local Government Association events, Planning conferences
Approach: "Live demo at your next team meeting?"

Channel 4: Warm Introductions
Target: Through council contacts, local business networks
Approach: "Can you introduce me to someone at [Council] who handles LA searches?"
```

### **Week 3-4: Follow-up & Demos**
```bash
Demo Scheduling:
- Offer flexible timing (early morning, lunch, after hours)
- Provide technical pre-demo if needed  
- Send demo recording if they can't attend live
- Follow up within 24 hours with next steps

Common Objections & Responses:
"We're happy with current system"
‚Üí "That's great! This could handle overflow during busy periods"

"We don't have budget"  
‚Üí "The pilot pays for itself in staff time savings within 4-6 weeks"

"We need to go through procurement"
‚Üí "Happy to work through your process. Many councils start with a small pilot"

"Integration sounds complex"
‚Üí "We've built connectors for [their system]. Setup takes 1-2 weeks"
```

## üìä **SUCCESS METRICS & VALIDATION**

### **Market Validation Targets (Month 1)**
```bash
Outreach Metrics:
- Contact 50+ councils via LinkedIn/email
- Schedule 10-15 discovery calls  
- Deliver 5-8 live demos
- Generate 3-5 serious pilot discussions

Validation Success:
- 2+ councils commit to paid pilot
- Clear understanding of required features
- Pricing validation (¬£2,000-5,000/month acceptable)
- Integration requirements identified

Market Demand Indicators:
‚úÖ Strong: 30%+ positive response to outreach
‚úÖ Moderate: 15-30% positive response  
‚ùå Weak: <15% positive response
```

### **Decision Matrix: Build vs Pivot**
```bash
STRONG DEMAND (Build Phase 2 enhancements):
- 2+ pilot commitments secured
- Total pilot value >¬£20,000
- Clear path to 5+ council rollouts
- Specific feature requirements validated

MODERATE DEMAND (Optimize before building):
- 1 pilot commitment + strong interest from others
- Feedback indicates specific missing features
- Price sensitivity identified
- Integration requirements clearer

WEAK DEMAND (Pivot or adjust):  
- No pilot commitments after 50+ contacts
- Consistent objections about value proposition
- Budget constraints across all councils
- Technical barriers too high
```

## üí° **KEY INSIGHT: Validation > Feature Building**

**Your current system is more capable than you think!**

### **What You CAN Demo Today:**
- ‚úÖ Complete LA workflow from application to completion
- ‚úÖ Automated document processing with 60-70% success rate
- ‚úÖ Real-time status tracking and SLA management
- ‚úÖ Payment processing and customer communications  
- ‚úÖ Spatial intelligence and automated CON29 answers
- ‚úÖ Bulk import capability (even if slower)
- ‚úÖ Multi-user access and role management

### **What Councils Care About Most:**
1. **Speed:** "Can you really cut our processing time?"
2. **Accuracy:** "Will this cause more errors?"  
3. **Integration:** "How does this fit with our systems?"
4. **Cost:** "What's the ROI calculation?"
5. **Risk:** "What if something goes wrong?"

### **The Validation Strategy:**
**Don't hide limitations - position them as roadmap items**

*"We currently automate 70% of cases, with our enhanced AI launching next quarter targeting 90%+ automation"*

*"Our bulk import currently processes 100 cases per hour, with our performance upgrade targeting 1000+ per hour"*

**This shows capability AND growth trajectory, making councils comfortable with early adoption.**

## üéØ **BOTTOM LINE RECOMMENDATION**

### **Start Validation This Week:**
- **Investment:** ¬£1-2k for professional demo environment
- **Time:** 10-20 hours for outreach and demos  
- **Risk:** Minimal - you'll learn exactly what market wants

### **Build Based on Validation Results:**
- **Strong demand:** Invest ¬£8-15k in proven requirements
- **Moderate demand:** Optimize current system first
- **Weak demand:** Pivot value proposition or target market

**The ¬£100k+ investment is only justified AFTER you have validated council demand and have multiple pilot commitments secured.**
