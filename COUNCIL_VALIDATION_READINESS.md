## 🚨 **CRITICAL INSIGHT: Start with Validation**

**Don't build everything before you know there's demand!**

### **What You Should Do This Week:**
1. **Polish current system for demos** (£1-2k max)
2. **Create professional demo materials** 
3. **Schedule 5-10 council discovery calls**
4. **Present current capabilities honestly**
5. **Validate specific council requirements**

### **What Success Looks Like:**
- **3+ councils say:** *"This is interesting, we'd consider a pilot"*
- **1-2 councils say:** *"We'd pay for a 3-month pilot"*  
- **Clear understanding of:** *"Here's exactly what you need to add"*

### **Then Invest Based on Validated Demand:**
- **Strong interest:** Invest £8-15k in demo enhancements
- **Pilot commitments:** Invest £20-35k in full system  
- **Weak interest:** Pivot or adjust value proposition

**The key is not to guess what councils want - validate first, then build exactly what they need.**
